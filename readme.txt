Raspberry Pi camera web app

*in progress!*

Idea is: you take a photo with the Raspberry Pi, it makes a shutter sound (with some little built in speakers)
and saves the image into a gallery you can view on an ipad or connected computer.

Makes use of the Holga Raspberry Pi case I've put together here:
http://kimondo.co.uk/raspberry-pi-camera-case-from-a-holga/

Will be adding a python script to control the shutter and make a sound / light up an LED when taking your picture

Uses: Simple camera control interface - haven't thought that far yet, but here are a few:
a photo me booth with a big friendly button
a sound activated camera

Requires:
A Raspberry Pi
A wifi adapter
A Raspberry Pi camera board
A groovy case to stick them in
A few LEDs, switches, connectors (optional)
Setting up the Pi to act as a webserver, with a static IP

Makes use of:
This php code for generating image thumbnails:
